## reverse array 
* reverse array without using built in methods 
## approach and efficiency
* takes users data for the array they want to fill i could have done this with a template array but i decided to give user the access to add to their own array
* i uses while loop that remains infinite as long as two requirements are meant wich are that the user says yes to adding to an array and that the user dosn't quitonce the user is done they can press quit and it will brak the loop 
* i used the while loop so the user can add as many things to the index as they want 
* next we reverse the array by a slice method by taking the array filled with the user input data and prints it backwards
* the slice method can be used other ways if we want to make higher levels of the aplication it is not just limited to print thats just how i percived this challenge
# Solution
* our solution uses a while loop to populate the array with inputs and uses a slice method that reverses the array so that the data that is appended shows up backwards to the user
