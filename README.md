* the task was to add up the matrix i could only get the atrrays within the matrix to do that if i could find out some way on how to break local varibles out of functios i would be set. i maybe could do this as one giant function 
# approach 
* my approach was to add up the individual arrays an then add up the arrays total i honestly would use the sum method on the index values with  in the array and then use the sum method to add up the return of each array
# solution
* add individual arrays up together
